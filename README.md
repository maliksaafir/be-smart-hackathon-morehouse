# American Airlines Travel Assistant

### Our application was designed to inform AA customers of the time at which they should leave their homes to get to the airport with ample time to get through checkpoints and TSA before their flight.

It utilizes the following APIs and technologies:
- American Airlines Mock API
- Google Maps Directions API
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

*This code was designed and developed by Malik Saafir, Isaiah Bayas, and Jeremy Kearse for the Black Enterprise SMART Hackathon sponsored by American Airlines during October 2018.*
